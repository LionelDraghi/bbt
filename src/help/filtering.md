Filtering:
  Features, Scenarios and Steps may be selected or filtered.
  By default, every item is selected.
  -s | --select 'string'  : only items containing 'string' are selected
  -e | --exclude 'string' : remove from selection items containing 'string'
  -i | --include 'string' : include in selection items containing 'string'
  Multiple occurrences are processed in order, meaning that you can exclude
  a whole Feature and then re-include a Scenario belonging to this feature.
