## Feature: on error, Keep going or stop

During debug, bbt helps the developer focusing on the first problem by just stopping the run.  
This is the default behavior.  
On the other hand, in a batch run, one usually wants to run all tests even if some fails.  
btt allows this second behavior through the `--keep_going` (or `-k`) option.  

The default behavior is to stop on the first error.
If there is a syntax error in the md file, following steps are ignored.
If there is an error when running 
a step, the result synthesis will display some "not run" tests.

But if `-k` is specified, the run goes to the end, all scenarios and steps are run, and the synthesis is displayed with fail/pass/empty tests, but no "not run" tests.

In both case, the total is the same.

Here we run a test with 3 scenarios.  
The second fails.  
When run with `-k`, the run will end with 1 fail test and 2 success.  
When run without, the run ends with 1 fail, 1 success and 1 not run.

### Background: setup
- Given the file `feature1.md`
```
### Scenario 1
- When I run `./sut -h`
- Then I get no error

### Scenario 2
- When I `./sut -h`   
  --> ** bbt syntax error here (the verb is missing)**

- Then I get no error 
  --> if run, this line should fail

### Scenario 3
- When I run `./sut -v`
- Then I get no error
```

# Scenario: with `-k`
- When I run `./bbt -k feature1.md`
- then output is
```
## [feature1.md](feature1.md)  
  - [X] scenario [1](feature1.md) pass  
feature1.md:6: Error: Unrecognized step "When I `./sut -h`   "
  - [ ] scenario [2](feature1.md) fails  
  - [X] scenario [3](feature1.md) pass

| Failed     | 1     |
| Successful | 2     |
| Empty      | 0     |

# Scenario: without `-k`
- When I run `./bbt feature1.md`
- then output is

feature1.md:6: Error: Unrecognized step "When I `./sut -h`   "
  - [ ] scenario [2](feature1.md) fails
