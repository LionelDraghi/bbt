## TDL

### near future
  
### distant future or low priority
- Given execution directory `dir1`  
- interactive exec
- environment
- diff 
- append 
- implement "case insensitive" and "ignore blank lines" 
- clean function : bbt delete all files created during execution
- explore the possibility to run multiple exe asynchronously, while staying simple.
  Maybe by using the AdaCore spawn lib.
- "should be" as "is" synonym?
