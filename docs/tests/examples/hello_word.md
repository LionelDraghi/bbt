# gcc simple sanity tests

## Scenario: gcc version?

- When I run `/usr/bin/gcc -v`

- Then the output contains `gcc version`
  
  (we don't test here the actual version number)

## Scenario: compiling and executing an hello word

- Given the new file `main.c`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
printf("Hello, World!");
return 0;
}
```
  Note that `bbt` will propose to overwrite any existing *main.c* file, to ensure that we are compiling this precise file.

- And given there is no `main` file
  
  Same principle, `bbt` will erase any existing *main* exe to ensure that the executed main was effectively generated by the following compilation.

- When I run `/usr/bin/gcc main.c -o main`
- And  I run `main`

- Then the output is `Hello, World!`
